Comment: We repack the upstream mu-editor source for a couple of reasons:
 1. We remove upstream git, CI and Windows configuration files.
 .
 2. We remove the upstream debian/ directory.
 .
 3. The following images are included in the upstream source (documented in
 docs/copyright.rst) but are not DFSG-compatible due to the following reasons:
 .
 - docs/beautifully_useless.jpg - prohibits commercial use
 - docs/circuit_playground.jpg - released under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 license
 - docs/python.png - restricted commercial use
 .
 4. We remove uflash.py which is packaged separately (python3-uflash).
 Note that this file also includes a non-DFSG-compatible string representation
 of the compiled MicroPython firmware for the micro:bit single board computer.
 .
 5. Although released under a DFSG-compatible license, the compiled
 Source Code Pro font files are removed from the upstream source as the
 toolchain required to build them is not yet available in Debian (#762252)
 .
 6. We remove OSX and Windows packaging/installation files
 .
 7. We remove eep.wav due to unknown author and license details
 .
 8. We remove mu/locale/vi/* as it is licensed CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0

     Go for it! Feel free to do whatever weird(and not weird) things you
     like with it.

     It's a modification (by me) of a logo by Gareth Noyce, who also put
     the logo files in public domain.
 .
     Gareth Noyce said of the logo files:
     They're public domain but I'd like attribution if they're used
     anywhere.  Just a "logo by Gareth Noyce" would do, but I won't be
     complaining if people forget. :)'
